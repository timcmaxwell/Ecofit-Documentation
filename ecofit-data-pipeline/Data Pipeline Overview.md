The Ecofit data pipeline is a highly automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) service taking raw Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data collected from the Scottish, Northern Irish and England and Wales Government, and with minimal user interaction adding it to the Ecofit Database. The pipeline has been developed to remove the abnormalities of EPC data, add new data fields to allow for further manipulation and calculation by users, and retain a schema allowing for future scalability without loss of data.
